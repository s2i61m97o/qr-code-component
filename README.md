## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Flexbox is a useful layout tool even if the dynamic function it is widely used for is not a primary concern. Using flexbox in this challenge allowed me to quickly and easily center align - both vertically and horizontally - the entire qr-card to the center of the page. 

One of the key things I learnt from this challenge is the use of Figma design files and how to retrieve the required information from those files to allow an accurate copy of the design needs. 

### Continued development

I will be continuing to learn and develop my understanding of flexbox to able to use it within coming projects as well as continuing to understand more complex Figma design files.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand how to use flexbox for layout purposes.
